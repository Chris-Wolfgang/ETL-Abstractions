# Wolfgang.Etl.Abstractions Documentation

Welcome to the Wolfgang.Etl.Abstractions API documentation.

## Overview

This package contains interfaces and base classes for building ETLs using a specific design pattern.

The ETL design pattern is a common approach in data processing that involves three main stages:
- **Extract**: Retrieving data from various sources.
- **Transform**: Processing and transforming the extracted data into a desired format.
- **Load**: Storing the transformed data into a target system.

## Getting Started

See the [API Documentation](api/index.md) for detailed information about the available interfaces and classes.
